# ElevatorProject
This project is meant to simulate the elevator management of a condo/highrise.

The system will allow for the creation of a Tenant which includes name, unit number, floor and cost of rent. 
The system will allow the movement of Tenants to the floors which they are granted permission to be on. 
The tenants will be allowed to travel to the floor which their unit is on, they will be denied to all other floors. 

More implementation will be added in the future.
