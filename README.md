# ElevatorProject

> This application is a basic management for an elevator inside of a hotel / condo building. The user will be allowed to create "Tenants" and will be   asked to input information for each tenant. Name, Unit number, Floor and Rent will be input for each tenant and will be stored in the Elevator         object. From there the user will be allowed to send the Tenants to floors on the hotel / condo, but only to the ones that the tenants are given       access to. The floor that the tenant is allowed to travel to is the one that was stated when creating the tenant. If the user trys to move the         tenant to a floor they do not have access to they will be denied!
